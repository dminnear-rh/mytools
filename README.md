## 📥 Installation

To make these tools easily accessible from anywhere, symlink them into `~/.local/bin` using the included Makefile:

```bash
make install
```

If `~/.local/bin` is not in your `PATH`, add this to `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

Then reload your shell:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc  # or source ~/.bashrc
```
